# Changelog

Release notes for Carbon. The release pipeline extracts the section whose heading
starts with the pushed tag (e.g. `## v0.6.0`) and uses it verbatim as both the
GitHub Release body and the public mirror commit message — so keep each heading's
first token equal to the tag. See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).
